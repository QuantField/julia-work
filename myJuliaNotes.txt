type Te
    x :: Float64
    y :: Float64
end

P = Te(0,0) #  means x=0, y=0
P.x 
0
P.y
0
===============
if we define a variable 
a = 2.3
and we want to change it  from within a function we must use
the word global:

function t()
 global a
 a = a^2
end

after runnig t() the value of a would have changed
